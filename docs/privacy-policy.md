# Privacy Policy — C64 Commander

**Effective date:** 19 January 2026

## Overview

C64 Commander does not collect, transmit, or share personal data. All functionality operates locally on your device and communicates only with devices or servers explicitly required to provide the app’s features.

The app does not operate any backend services and does not send data to servers operated by the app developer.

## Data storage and processing

C64 Commander stores a limited amount of data **locally on your device only**, solely to support core functionality.

This may include:

- **Device connection settings**, such as the network address of your C64 Ultimate.
- **Optional device access credentials**, such as a password you enter to access your C64 Ultimate.  
  These credentials are stored locally using the platform’s secure storage mechanisms.
- **Diagnostic and application logs**, used for local troubleshooting and debugging.

This data:

- Remains on your device at all times.
- Is not transmitted to the developer or to any third party.
- Is not used for analytics, profiling, tracking, or advertising.

You may remove this data at any time by clearing the app’s data or uninstalling the app.

## Data not collected

C64 Commander does **not** collect or use:

- Personal identifiers.
- Analytics or usage metrics.
- Crash reporting data.
- Advertising identifiers.
- User accounts or login information.

## Network communication

C64 Commander performs network communication only for the following purposes:

- **Local device communication:**  
  The app communicates with a C64 Ultimate device configured by the user, typically over the local network. This communication is required to read device state, update settings, and transfer files for playback.

- **Optional content download:**  
  At the user’s request, the app may download the High Voltage SID Collection (HVSC) from its official public site at <https://www.hvsc.c64.org/>. This process retrieves **SID music files**, which are data files containing music composed for the Commodore 64’s SID sound chip and contain no personal information.

  The downloaded files are stored locally on the user’s device, and no personal data or identifiers are transmitted as part of this process.

No other external network communication is performed.

## Third-party software

The app includes open-source libraries used for user interface rendering and device integration. A full list of included third-party software and applicable licenses is available in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## Children’s privacy

C64 Commander is not directed at children and does not knowingly collect personal information.

## Changes to this policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the revised version will be published with the app and will replace the previous version.
